	# uploadDataset.sh

## Overview
`uploadDataset.sh` is a shell script designed to upload and process genomic dataset files into a target database.  
It takes several arguments such as dataset name, variantset name, sample list, and position file to perform a batch upload and log the output.

This script is typically used in bioinformatics data pipelines for managing large variant or sequencing datasets (e.g., 3K Rice Genomes Project or variant sets).

## Usage

```bash
./uploadDataset.sh <DATABASE_NAME> <VARIANTSET_NAME> <SAMPLE_LIST_FILE> <POSITION_FILE> <ORGANISM_NAME_OR_REFERENCE>
```

### Example
```bash
./uploadDataset.sh IR64 IR64 ../3k+15vgenome33.PV1.ir64/sample_list.txt ../3k+15vgenome33.PV1.ir64/pos.txt IR64 > 3039_output.log 2>&1 &
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `<DATASET_NAME>` | Name or ID of the dataset being uploaded. Used for labeling or database reference. | `IR64` |
| `<VARIANTSET_NAME>` | Variantset name associated with the dataset. | `IR64` |
| `<SAMPLE_LIST_FILE>` | Path to a text file containing a list of samples to include in the upload. | `../3k+15vgenome33.PV1.ir64/sample_list.txt` |
| `<POSITION_FILE>` | Path to a file containing genomic positions or SNP coordinates. | `../3k+15vgenome33.PV1.ir64/pos.txt` |
| `<OUTPUT_PREFIX>` | Prefix used for naming output or intermediate files. | `IR64` |

## Output


## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| `Permission denied` | Script is not executable | Run `chmod +x uploadDataset.sh` |
| `File not found` | Incorrect path to sample or position file | Check and update file paths |
| `Upload incomplete` | Script interrupted or missing input data | Re-run the command and check logs |
| `Database connection failed` | Network or credentials issue | Verify DB settings inside the script |
